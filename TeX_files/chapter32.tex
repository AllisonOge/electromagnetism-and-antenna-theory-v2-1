\chapter{Total Internal Reflection}
\paragraph{}In this lecture we will discuss a special case of reflection in a dielectric boundary called Total Internal Reflection. We studied total internal reflection at High School level where we said the ray is incident at an angle greater than critical angle and the power is reflected back to the same medium. However that understanding is a rather superficial one. Here we do a detailed study of the phenomenal called TOTAL INTERNAL REFLECTION.

\section{Snell's Law}From Snell's Law,
\begin{align}
\beta_1 \sin\theta_i = \beta_2 \sin\theta_t
\end{align}
where $\beta_1 and \beta_2$ are the phase constants in the two media. \\ \\
writing eqn(32.1) in terms of medium parameters
\begin{align*}
\omega\sqrt{\mu_1\epsilon} \sin\theta_i = \omega\sqrt{\mu_2\epsilon_2}  \sin\theta_t
\end{align*}
\begin{center}
	or
\end{center}
\begin{align*}
\sqrt{\mu_1\epsilon} \sin\theta_i = \sqrt{\mu_2\epsilon_2}  \sin\theta_t
\end{align*} \\ \\
If medium parameters becomes such that
\begin{align}
\frac{\beta_1}{\beta_2}\sin\theta_i > 1
\end{align}then there is no wave nature in medium 2 for which the angle $\sin\theta_t$ is propagating. It's more of an imaginary angle which lacks direction.
And even though phase conditions in eq(32.1) is satisfied, there is no physical angle $\theta_t$ for which
\begin{align}
\sin\theta_t > 1
\end{align}This poses a very interesting case. \\ \\
Now we require in our reflection co-efficient expression that the quantity
\begin{align}
\cos\theta_t = \sqrt{1-\sin^2\theta_t}
\end{align}
\begin{center}
subt. eq.(32.2) in eq.(32.4)
\end{center}
\begin{align*}
\cos\theta_t = \sqrt{1-(\frac{\beta_1}{\beta_2}\sin\theta_i)^2}
\end{align*}
this leaves the quantity $-(\frac{\beta_1}{\beta_2}\sin\theta_i)^2$ always negative and imaginary.So we make it positive to satisfy the medium parameter in which $\frac{\beta_1}{\beta_2}\sin\theta_i > 1$
\begin{align}
\cos\theta_t = \jmath\sqrt{(\frac{\beta_1}{\beta_2}\sin\theta_i)^2-1}
\end{align}
Now again, we see clearly that from eqn(32.3) and eqn(32.5) 
that there is no physical angle $\theta_t$ in which the wave would be propagated.\\
However for the angle $\theta_t$ and $\theta_i$ we would still have reflection and transmission co-efficients, so we go back and substitute $\cos\theta_t$ in the reflection co-efficient expression.\\
Recall we had two cases of reflection co-efficients.
\begin{align*}
\end{align*}For the Perpendicular case:
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_\perp\ = \frac{\eta_2\cos\theta_i - \eta_1\cos\theta_t}{\eta_2\cos\theta_i + \eta_1\cos\theta_t}
\end{equation}\\
For the Parallel case:
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_\parallel = \frac{\eta_1\cos\theta_i - \eta_2\cos\theta_t}{\eta_1\cos\theta_i + \eta_2\cos\theta_t}
\end{equation}
Note: $\eta_1$ and $\eta_2$ are interchanged for both cases otherwise they are similar. \\
\begin{center}
	substituting eqn(32.5) in eqn(32.7)
\end{center}
\begin{align}
\Gamma_\parallel = \frac{\eta_1\cos\theta_i - \jmath\eta_2\sqrt{(\frac{\beta_1}{\beta_2}\sin\theta_i)^2-1}}{\eta_1\cos\theta_i + \jmath\eta_2\sqrt{(\frac{\beta_1}{\beta_2}\sin\theta_i)^2-1}}
\end{align}
Note: we would get the same expression for the perpendicular polarization case but with $\eta_1$ and $\eta_2$ interchanged.\\ \\
What's important to note here is that the expression in eqn(32.8) is of the form

\begin{equation}
\frac{a - \jmath b}{b + \jmath b}
\end{equation}

and always have a magnitude equal  to 1 and an angle $\angle-\tan^-1(\frac{b}{a})$ that is:
\begin{equation}
|\frac{a - \jmath b}{a + \jmath b}| = 1\angle - 2\tan^{-1}(\frac{b}{a})
\end{equation} \\
And since the modulus of reflection co-efficient is 1, whatever is incidence or the media is totally reflected.

\section{Conditions For Total Internal Reflection}
1. If total internal reflection has to take place then,
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\beta_1}{\beta_2}\sin\theta_i > 1
\end{equation*}
in terms of medium parameters
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\sqrt{\mu_1\epsilon_1}}{\sqrt{\mu_2\epsilon_2}}\sin\theta_i > 1
\end{equation*}
$\theta_i$ can attain a maximum value of $90^\bullet$, therefore $\sin\theta_i$ = $\sin$90 = 1, this means,
\begin{equation}
\sqrt{\mu_1\epsilon_1} > \sqrt{\mu_2\epsilon_2}
\end{equation}
and there is a possibility of total internal reflection.\\
For non-magnetic material, $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$
\begin{equation*}
\sqrt{\epsilon_1} > \sqrt{\epsilon_2}
\end{equation*}
\begin{align*}
n_1 > n_2
\end{align*} \begin{center}
$n_1$ and $n_2$ are refractive indexes
\end{center} 
Now for the angle at whcih $\sin\theta_t = 1$ is called the CRITICAL ANGLE, beyond which if an incident wave is launched, there would be no transmitted wave in the second medium.\\
Explaining this phenomenon with the fig 32.1 below.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{fig321}
	\caption{graph of critical angle}
\end{figure}\
\begin{equation*}
\sqrt{\mu_1\epsilon_1} \sin\theta_c = \sqrt{\mu_2\epsilon_2}
\end{equation*}
\begin{align*}
n_1 \sin\theta_c = n_2
\end{align*}
\begin{center}
	OR
\end{center}
Critical angle
\begin{align*}
\theta_c = \sin^{-1}(\frac{n_2}{n_1}) 
\end{align*}
So in general, we can say that by choosing appropriate parameters for the media, and the angle of incidence, we can generate arbitrary phase difference between the incidence and the reflected ray. This would happen for both parallel and perpendicular polarization. However the parallel and perpendicular polarization have $\eta_1$ and $\eta_2$
interchanged between them. So a and b in $\frac{a - \jmath b}{b + \jmath b}$ are different for parallel and perpendicular polarizations. This means that the phase change which the wave undergoes for the two polarization are different.\\ \\
2. Wave undergoes a phase change at Total Internal Reflection\\
Phase change is different for parallel and perpendicular polarizations.\\
If we write out explicitly:
\begin{equation}
\phi_\parallel = -2\tan^{-1}\frac{\eta_2\sqrt{(\frac{\beta_1}{\beta_2}\sin\theta_i)^2-1}}{\eta_1\cos\theta_i}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\phi_\perp = -2\tan^{-1}\frac{\eta_1\sqrt{(\frac{\beta_1}{\beta_2}\sin\theta_i)^2-1}}{\eta_2\cos\theta_i}
\end{equation}
From here we see that the two polarization do not undergo a phase change. But later we'll see the implication about the phase change for the different kinds of polarization when Total Internal Reflection takes place in the dielectric boundary. \\ \\
3. For fields in medium 2\\ \\
Recall:\\
The phase expression for a transmitted wave in medium 2 is
\begin{equation*}
\varepsilon_t = e^{-\jmath \beta_2(x\sin\theta_t + z\cos\theta_t)}
\end{equation*}\\

From Snell's Law and keeping phase gradient same $\varepsilon_t$ is written out explicitly as:
\begin{align}
\varepsilon_te^{- \jmath x\beta_2\sin\theta_t - \jmath z\beta_2\cos\theta_t}
\end{align}
substituting for $\cos\theta_t$ from eqn(32.5)
and $\sin\theta_t$ from eqn(32.1)
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon_te^{- {\jmath x\beta_1\sin\theta_i} - z \beta_2\sqrt{{(\frac{\beta_1}{\beta_2}\sin\theta_i)}^2 - 1}}
\end{equation}\\
From the above equation,

Amplitude term:
\begin{equation}
-z\sqrt{\beta_1^2\sin^2\theta_i - \beta_2}
\end{equation}
\begin{align*}
\end{align*}
and the phase term:
\begin{equation}
e^{- \jmath x\beta_1\sin\theta_i}
\end{equation}
From these equations, we see the field are exponentially dying down as a function of z and a phase which varies as a function of x.\\
Now with total internal reflection, the travelling wave nature are only in z direction. The fields are no longer travelling in x direction.\\ \\
Explicitly, eqn(32.16) essentially represents decaying fields and eqn(32.17) gives a travellilng wave in x direction.\\ \
The graph of this field is shown in the plot fig 32.2
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{fig322}
	\caption{Graph of travelling waves fields}
\end{figure}\\ \\
At angle $\theta_t >$ $\theta_c$ the decay is faster as shown in the graphs. 
So as angle of incidence increases more and more beyond the critical angle, the field gets more and more confined towards the dielectric interface. So at critical angle, the field thermally extend up to infinity at a constant amplitude. The important observation is the field never goes to zero in medium 2 under no condition. The field is always non-zero in medium 2. Theoritically, no matter how small this amplitude is, it will extend up to infinity in the direction Z, it gets closer and closer to zero but never zero.
So when total internal reflection takes place from medium 1 at high school level, it was like the total power reflected back to medium 1 and nothing existed in medium 2. In fact there was no discussion at all as to what were the behaviour of the fields in 2 or the role medium 2 needed to play in total internal reflection. Once we had the critical condition for total internal reflection satisfied, we didn't bother about the point beyond the boundary into medium 2. Now we can't ignore the region in medium 2 beyond the boundary. The fields have to exist in the form shown in medium 2 for total internal reflection to take place, and they are as important as the fields in medium 1. The field in medium 2 are required for us to satisfy continuity equation at the boundary. It is this fields in medium 2 that is supporting the total internal reflection phenomenon. If any disturbance is created to these fields in medium from fig 32.2, the total internal reflection reflection phenomenon is also disturbed and we cannot have total internal reflection, also the power will flow to medium 2. So to have a good total internal reflection phenomenon, we must have the field in medium 2 as confined to the interface as much as possible. That means we must launch a wave with an angle larger than the critical angle for as much as is possible so that the field will die down in medium 2 as fast as possible and so that it is confined to a thickness Z in medium 2 that is extremely small.\\
	Secondly, we must provide certain region from the dielectric interface in medium 2 of thickness Z(ideally Z should be at infinity) where the fields in medium 2 are protected. If these two conditions are guaranteed, we have a total internal reflection phenomenon in the medium. Theoritically, unless we provide an infinite medium in 2, and the fields properly protected in medium 2, we cannot have total internal reflection phenomenon.\\
\section{Reactive Fields}
\paragraph{}Our conclusion is that when total internal reflection takes place, the field in medium 2 exist, the transmission co-efficient is not zero. When the total power is reflected, $|\Gamma| = 1$. It doesn't mean that the transmission co-efficient is zero. The transmission co-efficient doesn't mean that there is a power flow in medium 2. As we have seen the fields which are dying down in medium 2 are the ones which do not constitute power flow as the wave is not travelling inside the medium. The wave is still travelling in x direction along the dielectric interface. There is no power flow in the Z direction, but the fields exist. So we should clearly understand the difference having fields and no power flow, and having fields with power flow. You may have electric and magnetic fields and they may constitute power flow, as we have seen in earlier cases.\\ However, we might have a situation like this where we have electric and magnetic fields but there is no power flow. In the electrical circuit terminology we can call this field REACTIVE FIELDS, they have the energy stored in the transient phase when the field is being setup but no power flow. We visualize it as when the wave is incident on the interface or boundary, when the wave is being setup, there is some power flow into the second medium. That power flow gets stored in the energy in the second medium in the fields in the second medium. These fields are decaying fields. Once these fields are setup, in the steady state, no net power flows in the second medium and the power flow is essential in medium 1. These fields in medium 2 are referred to as EVENESCENT FILEDS (reactive fields). They will exist in medium 2 without constituting any power flow. The power flow will exist in the interface in the direction of x. Now for medium 1, we had a wave incident on it and another one which is reflected from the interface into medium 1. There is arbitrary phase change at the point of incidence and reflection as shown below.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{fig323}
	\caption{Graph of incidence and reflection}
\end{figure}\\
Fields in medium 1
\begin{equation}
E_i = E_i e^{- \jmath \beta_1(x\sin\theta_i + z\cos\theta_i)}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
E_r = E_r e^{- \jmath \beta_1(x\sin\theta_i - z\cos\theta_i)}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation*}
E = E_i + E_r
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
E = E_i e^{- \jmath \beta_1x\sin\theta_i}\{ 1e^{- \jmath \beta_1z\cos\theta_i} + e^{\jmath \theta}
e^{\jmath \beta_1\cos\theta_i} \}
\end{equation*}
Depending on the phase change $\theta_1$ at $z = 0$ the amplitude can be changed. M and N wave will create constructive or destructive interference as we saw in the case of transmission line. \\
So in medium 1 from the equation, we have a fully developed standing wave in z directions but a travelling wave in x direction. In medium 2 it was an exponentially decaying field, and a travelling wave in x direction with the same phase constant as in medium 1 travelling wave in x direction. We plot the fields now in the two media we have depending upon the phase of reflection $\phi$, so the field distribution is like a corrugated surface in medium 1 and a decaying field in medium 2. The constant phase plane is determined by $e^{- \jmath \beta_1x\sin\theta_i}$. So the constant phase plane is the yz plane. The constant amplitude plane is in the xy plane. So this complex amplitude distribution of the wave travels in the x direction with a phase constant $\beta_1\sin\theta_i$.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{fig324}
	\caption{Graph of field distribution}
\end{figure}

So whenever total internal reflection occurs, you have this complex distribution of amplitude in space, one side exponentially decaying fields, the other side standing wave kind of fields. This amplitude distribution travels in the x direction with a phase velocity $\beta_1\sin\theta_i$. So the phase velocity in the x direction $V_px = \frac{\omega}{\beta_1\sin\theta_i}$. What is the direction of net power flow? The field in medium 2 does not constitute any wave, so no power flow in the Z direction. With no power flow in Z direction in medium 2, there can be no power flow in Z direction in medium 1 also. Since if the power had come from medium 1 in the Z direction, and the power can't flow in medium 2, the interface does not consume power since we are talking of a completely lossless medium. Hence whatever power came from medium 1 incident on the boundary, essentially gets reflected back to give us the power flow perpendicular to the interface. Along the interface, there is a power flow, we had phase velocity. So when total internal reflection phenomenon takes place, the net power flow is along the interface. Or in other word, the dielectric interface is capable of guiding electromagnetic energy.\\




\section{Wave Guides}
\paragraph{} So we can make use of dielectric interface for guiding electromagnetic energy along the line. Precisely this is what is used in structures called WAVEGUIDES, and especially when we talk about dielectric media this is what happens in optical fibres. An optical fibre is nothing but a structure having a dielectric interface. So with a wave launched at an angle $\theta_i > \theta_c$,
then there is total internal reflection in medium 1. The field in medium 2 will exponentially decay along x direction. Power flow will be in z direction based on the coordinate axes used for this illustration.\\
So if we create some structure like this, it can carry electromagnetic energy over long distance without any loss as such. Energy is confined in the region of $n_1$ and it will propagate along z direction as a result of total internal reflection. So total internal reflection has played important role in modern optical communication, and helped in design of structures called optic fibres.
